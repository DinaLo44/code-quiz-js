# code-quiz-js

This project consisted of creating a quiz that would test the user about some basic knowledge on JavaScript.

When the user is introduced to the application, it gets a "welcome" message and underneath there is a "start" button that would take him to the quiz. Once the user is presented to the quiz, a timer will start counting down, letting the user 60 seconds to answer all 5 questions.

Once the user clicks on the answer, it will see a new question. If the user clicks on the wrong answer, the timer will subtract 10 seconds.

Once the user goes through all questions, it is presented with its score and is asked to submit its initials.

Here are some screenshots of the final application:
